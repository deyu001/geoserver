*==Description==
*GeoServer is an open source software server written in Java that allows users
*          to share and edit geospatial data.Designed for interoperability,
*          it publishes data from any major spatial data source using open standards.
*
*Being a community-driven project, GeoServer is developed, tested, and supported by
*      a diverse group of individuals and organizations from around the world.
*
*GeoServer is the reference implementation of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)
*          Web Feature Service (WFS) and Web Coverage Service (WCS) standards, as well as
*          a high performance certified compliant Web Map Service (WMS), compliant
*          Catalog Service for the Web (CSW) and implementing Web Processing Service (WPS).
*          GeoServer forms a core component of the Geospatial Web.
