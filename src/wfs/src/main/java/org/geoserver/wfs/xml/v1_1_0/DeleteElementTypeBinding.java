/*
 *==Description==
 *GeoServer is an open source software server written in Java that allows users
 *          to share and edit geospatial data.Designed for interoperability,
 *          it publishes data from any major spatial data source using open standards.
 *
 *Being a community-driven project, GeoServer is developed, tested, and supported by
 *      a diverse group of individuals and organizations from around the world.
 *
 *GeoServer is the reference implementation of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)
 *          Web Feature Service (WFS) and Web Coverage Service (WCS) standards, as well as
 *          a high performance certified compliant Web Map Service (WMS), compliant
 *          Catalog Service for the Web (CSW) and implementing Web Processing Service (WPS).
 *          GeoServer forms a core component of the Geospatial Web.

 *                  &lt;xsd:documentation&gt;
 *                    The Filter element is used to constrain the scope
 *                    of the delete operation to those features identified
 *                    by the filter.  Feature instances can be specified
 *                    explicitly and individually using the identifier of
 *                    each feature instance OR a set of features to be
 *                    operated on can be identified by specifying spatial
 *                    and non-spatial constraints in the filter.
 *                    If no filter is specified then an exception should
 *                    be raised since it is unlikely that a client application
 *                    intends to delete all feature instances.
 *                 &lt;/xsd:documentation&gt;
 *              &lt;/xsd:annotation&gt;

 *      &lt;xsd:attribute name="handle" type="xsd:string" use="optional"&gt;
 *          &lt;xsd:annotation&gt;
 *              &lt;xsd:documentation&gt;
 *                 The handle attribute allows a client application
 *                 to assign a client-generated request identifier
 *                 to an Insert action.  The handle is included to
 *                 facilitate error reporting.  If a Delete action
 *                 in a Transaction request fails, then a WFS may
 *                 include the handle in an exception report to localize
 *                 the error.  If no handle is included of the offending
 *                 Insert element then a WFS may employee other means of
 *                 localizing the error (e.g. line number).
 *              &lt;/xsd:documentation&gt;
 *          &lt;/xsd:annotation&gt;
 *      &lt;/xsd:attribute&gt;
 *      &lt;xsd:attribute name="typeName" type="xsd:QName" use="required"&gt;
 *          &lt;xsd:annotation&gt;
 *              &lt;xsd:documentation&gt;
 *                The value of the typeName attribute is the name
 *                of the feature type to be updated. The name
 *                specified must be a valid type that belongs to
 *                the feature content as defined by the GML
 *                Application Schema.
