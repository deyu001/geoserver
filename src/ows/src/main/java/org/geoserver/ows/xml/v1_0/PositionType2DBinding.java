/*
 *==Description==
 *GeoServer is an open source software server written in Java that allows users
 *          to share and edit geospatial data.Designed for interoperability,
 *          it publishes data from any major spatial data source using open standards.
 *
 *Being a community-driven project, GeoServer is developed, tested, and supported by
 *      a diverse group of individuals and organizations from around the world.
 *
 *GeoServer is the reference implementation of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)
 *          Web Feature Service (WFS) and Web Coverage Service (WCS) standards, as well as
 *          a high performance certified compliant Web Map Service (WMS), compliant
 *          Catalog Service for the Web (CSW) and implementing Web Processing Service (WPS).
 *          GeoServer forms a core component of the Geospatial Web.

The longitude value shall be listed first, followed by the latitude value, both in decimal degrees. Latitude values shall range from -90 to +90 degrees, and longitude values shall normally range from -180 to +180 degrees. For the longitude axis, special conditions apply when the bounding box is continuous across the +/- 180 degrees meridian longitude value discontinuity:
 *  a)  If the bounding box is continuous clear around the Earth, then longitude values of minus and plus infinity shall be used.
 *  b)  If the bounding box is continuous across the value discontinuity but is not continuous clear around the Earth, then some non-normal value can be used if specified for a specific OWS use of the WGS84BoundingBoxType. For more information, see Subclauses 10.4.5 and C.13. &lt;/documentation&gt;
