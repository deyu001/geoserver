 *==Description==
 *GeoServer is an open source software server written in Java that allows users
 *          to share and edit geospatial data.Designed for interoperability,
 *          it publishes data from any major spatial data source using open standards.
 *
 *Being a community-driven project, GeoServer is developed, tested, and supported by
 *      a diverse group of individuals and organizations from around the world.
 *
 *GeoServer is the reference implementation of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)
 *          Web Feature Service (WFS) and Web Coverage Service (WCS) standards, as well as
 *          a high performance certified compliant Web Map Service (WMS), compliant
 *          Catalog Service for the Web (CSW) and implementing Web Processing Service (WPS).
 *          GeoServer forms a core component of the Geospatial Web.
